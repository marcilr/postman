Postman is a Google Chrome app for interacting with HTTP APIs.
It presents you with a friendly GUI for constructing requests
and reading responses.  The people behind Postman also offer
an add-on package called Jetpacks, which includes some automation
tools and, most crucially, a Javascript testing library.
