Sending the first request
An API request lets you contact a server with
API endpoints that you want to reach and perform
some action. Those actions are HTTP methods.
The most common methods are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
The names of the methods are self-explanatory.  For
example GET enables you to retrieve data from a server.
POST enables you to add data to an existing file or
resource in a server. PUT lets you replace an existing
file or resource in a server. And DELETE lets you
delete data from a server.
